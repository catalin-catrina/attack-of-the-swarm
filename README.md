[Personal notes]
TODOs after submitting the project:
1. Add the possibility for the user to type his/her own name in an input (as per mockups specs)
2. Give names to each fighter of the swarm
3. Make it a 2-player game, users will take turns and will each fight a separate swarm army.
4. Keep scores for both players. Each attack adds 1 to the score, and the player who defeats the swarm in the lowest amount of attacks wins.
5. Make the damage random instead of adjusted for bee type.
6. Add functionality for critical hits.
7. Make the last standing member of the swarm transform into an evolved, stronger version of its class.
8. Re-design the UI
